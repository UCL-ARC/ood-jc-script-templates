# OnDemand Job Composer Script Templates

This repository contains job script templates for use with Open OnDemand's Job Composer.

They're pretty simple and don't template in variables or anything.

Each template must contain a `manifest.yml` file to be picked up by the Job Composer. See the [Job Composer documentation](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/customization.html#job-template-details) for details, or take a look at the default template.
